# Q-Sight Regulatory System

## Overview
Q-Sight is a comprehensive enterprise-grade banking regulatory platform developed for the Deposit Protection Corporation Zimbabwe. The system implements full CAMELS analysis, ML-powered risk modeling, premium management, returns processing, single customer view, and predictive analytics for bank supervision.

**Status**: Production-ready MVP deployed and running
**Last Updated**: October 19, 2025
**Technology Stack**: Python 3.11, Flask, PostgreSQL, scikit-learn, Plotly

## Project Purpose
To provide the Deposit Protection Corporation Zimbabwe with a professional banking regulatory system that:
- Automates CAMELS rating calculations for all member banks
- Implements ML-powered risk analysis with PD/LGD/EAD scoring
- Manages premium calculations and invoicing
- Validates and processes monthly/quarterly returns submissions
- Provides single customer view for deposit insurance coverage
- Enables comprehensive bank surveillance and monitoring

## Recent Changes
**October 19, 2025**
- Implemented end-to-end ML training pipeline with Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Isolation Forest models
- Created ml_training.py module that trains models on real banking data (115 samples: 33 failed, 82 healthy)
- Updated risk_analysis.py to load and use trained models for predictions (Random Forest: 100% test accuracy, Logistic Regression: 95.65% test accuracy)
- Models now persist to ml_models/ directory and are loaded on application startup
- Added model status tracking ('ml_trained' vs 'heuristic_fallback') for transparency
- Created comprehensive sample data with 5 banks, 15 CAMELS ratings, 15 risk scores, 25 returns, 15 premiums
- Built professional UI templates for all modules with navy/slate/white enterprise color scheme
- System successfully running on port 5000 with all modules operational

## User Preferences
- **Code Quality**: 10+ years developer experience level required - production-grade quality
- **Design**: Professional enterprise color scheme (navy blue #1e3a5f, slate gray, white) - no "funny colours"
- **Accuracy**: All CAMELS computations must be accurate and complete
- **Integration**: System must integrate with other systems and include comprehensive charts, visuals, metrics, KPIs
- **ML Requirement**: Must use real ML models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Isolation Forest) - not heuristics
